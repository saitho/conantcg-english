Here's a somewhat informal overview of the game rules and how to play before they reveal the full instruction manual.

## What kind of game is it?

Being based on Detective Conan, the TCG is thus about solving your very own mystery case!
Its cards feature many iconic characters, cases, and plot points.
Partnering up with your favorite Conan characters, gather evidence and aim to solve your case before your opponent does!

## Card Types

There are four card types:

* **Partner card:** Acts as your partner for the game. You can use it to deduce to gain evidence, and some cards have effects that require a specific color Partner to work. It also has the special `[Assist]` and `[Case Closed]` abilities, which are what you use to win the game.
* **Case card:** Represents the case you are trying to solve. It denotes the Case Level, or the amount of evidence you need to win the game, which depends on whether you go first or second. Your deck can only have cards that are the same color as your case. Use a token to denote whether it is currently the Case Phase or Resolution Phase of your case.
* **Character cards:** The main cards that go into your deck. They're the cards that you play onto your Scene (as in crime scene), and are what you mainly use to gain evidence.
* **Event cards:** Support cards. They feature scenes from the manga, and are discarded once you use their effects.

As a rule of thumb, you play the game with one Partner card and one Case card, along with a 40-card deck of Character and Event cards. You can only have up to 3 copies of the same card.
This is based on the ID of the card, so you can play 3 copies each of the above Conan cards since they have different IDs.

## How to play the game

* **Scene:** Where you play Character cards onto. You can only have up to 5 Characters on the Scene at a time. If you were to play another one, you can choose to discard a Character already on the Scene to play the new one.
* **Partner:** Place your Partner card here at the start of a game.
* **Case:** Place your Case card here at the start of a game.
* **Deck:** Where you place the deck that you draw cards from.
* **File Area:** Place Files here from your deck facedown, sideways. Files determine what level cards you are allowed to play.
* **Assist:** The black box in the File Area, where you place your Partner after using its `[Assist]` ability.
* **Evidence Area:** Place Evidence here from your deck facedown. You get Evidence by making deductions or actions with your Partner or Character cards.
* **Remove Area:** Where you place your Character or Event cards that are removed from game.

### Starting a game

When you start a game, you place your Partner and Case cards onto the playing area, then shuffle your deck. Both players draw a starting hand of 5 cards, and are allowed to mulligan their hand by shuffling any cards from their hand into the deck and drawing the same number of cards.

**Note:** If your deck happens to run out of cards in the middle of a game, you shuffle all the cards in the Remove Area into your deck. If you do so, the opponent gains one Evidence.

## The Steps of the Game

### Auto Phase

1. Put your Partner card into Active mode. If it's in the File Area, put it back in the Partner zone.
2. Take your Characters that are in Sleep mode but put them into Active mode.
3. Draw a card from your deck and add it to your hand.
4. Take two cards from the top of your deck and put them into your File Area facedown. These act as your Files, which determine what level cards you are allowed to play. (Note: for the player going first, they only add one File instead of two on their first turn.)

### Main Phase

Do any of the following actions in any order:

1. **Play a card from your hand,** namely a Character card or an Event card. You can only play cards with a Level (top left corner number) that is lower than or equal to the amount of Files that you have. By default, you can only play one card per turn,
2. **Use a Next Hint.** Any time during the Main Phase, you can choose to use a Next Hint, in which you can add a File to your hand. After using a Next Hint, you can play another card from your hand, keeping in mind the newly decreased File count.
3. **Use a Character card's "Declare" effect.** Declare effects are effects that you can choose to activate during the Main Phase. Generally, these effects can only be used once per turn or have some sort of requirement to be used.
4. **Make a deduction.** Select a Partner or Character card and put it into Sleep mode (turn it sideways). If you do, gain Evidence by putting cards from the top of your deck facedown into the Evidence Area. The amount of Evidence you gain is based on the LP of the card used to deduce. (Note: A Character can't made a deduction the turn it is played)
5. **Take an action.** You can take an action with a Character card by sleeping it. Like deductions, a Character can't take action the turn it is played. When you take action, you can either target the opposing case, or an opposing Character that's in Sleep mode. The opponent can choose to guard the action by sleeping a Character they control.  
   **Action (Case):**  If the opponent does not guard when you take action on their case, the opponent discards an Evidence and you gain an Evidence.  
   **Contact:** When you take action on a Character, or when the opponent guards an action, a contact between the two Characters occurs. Compare the two Characters' AP, and remove the defending Character if the Character making the action has higher AP. Each player may choose to use one `[Cut In]` ability from their hand to increase the AP of their Character.  
6. **Use your Partner's abilities.** A Partner card has two abilities: `[Assist]` and `[Case Closed]`.  
   **For Assist**, sleep the Partner card and put it into your File Area. This increases the number of cards in your File Area, thus increasing the Level threshold of what cards you can play. In addition, after using `[Assist]`, if the number of cards in your File Area are 7 or higher, the case changes from Case Phase to Resolution Phase. (Denote this status with a token or marker)  
   **For Case Closed**, activate only if the case is in Resolution Phase. By sleeping the Partner, if your Evidence count is greater than or equal to your Case Level, you win the game. Using this ability is the primary way in which you win the game.  
   Note that both abilities require you to Sleep the Partner, which means you can't use these abilities the same turn you deduce with the Partner, nor can you use both in one turn.

### End Phase

Your turn ends, and the game is passed onto the opponent. Any effects that end or activate when your turn ends occur now.

### General flow of the game

1. Accumulate Files throughout the game, using them to play Character or Event cards.
2. Make deductions with your Characters or Partner to gain Evidence. Take actions with your Characters to disrupt the opponent by removing their Evidence or Characters.
3. When you reach seven Files, use your Partner's `[Assist]` to turn your case into Resolution Phase.
4. Reach enough Evidence to match your Case Level, then use your Partner's `[Case Closed]` to win the game.
